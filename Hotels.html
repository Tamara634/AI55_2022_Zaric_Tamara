        <p class="mt-4">
        Accommodation is one of the biggest fixed costs travelers have and reducing that cost can lead to big savings on the road! I’m sure many backpackers would sleep in a barn if it was the cheapest accommodation they could find! Heck, I’ve slept in hammocks in national parks to save a buck!
        </p>
        But that’s not something you have to do.
        <p>
        No matter what your accommodation tastes may be, one thing everyone has in common is that no one wants to pay a fortune for it. Since you have to stay somewhere every night, reducing this expense can save you a lot of money off the total cost of your trip. Next to finding a cheap flight, finding free or inexpensive lodging will have the biggest impact on your budget.
        </p>
        <p>
        Luckily, there are many ways to find cheap accommodation when you travel. Here are the best ways to do so.

        <h2>#1: Stay in Hostels</h2>

        <p>Hostels are another option for budget travelers. In hostels, rooms are dormitory-style with all the facilities shared. Many people think of hostels as a “young person thing” and are not interested in sleeping in a dormitory. Yet people do not often realize that many hostels offer small rooms, singles, and doubles designed for solo travelers or couples.
        <br> 
        I have met people in hostels in their 50s, 60s, and even in their 70s! The myth that they are dirty, gross places to stay designed for young people is outdated. Many hostels offer more amenities than hotels and are really clean as young people expect more comfort. These aren’t the hostels you see in movies or have the horror stories your parents talk about. They come with Wi-Fi, tour desks, bars, curtains, lockers for your stuff, big bathrooms, and lots more! I am constantly amazed at how hostels get better and better each yer.
        </p>
        <p>
        I think hostel dorms are the best value for budget travelers. Yes, you have to share a room with a lot of people, but if you are on a budget, it’s your best way to save money.
        While many hostels are geared toward young travelers and set age limits, some of the bigger international chains such as YHA and Hostelling International focus more on older or group travelers. I’ve seen families, tour groups, and older travelers in hostels all over the world. A hostel is really for anyone who wants to meet other travelers, regardless of age.

        Hostels are safe, secure, and cheap. Don’t overlook them — even if you’re not part of the young backpacker set.
        This page has all my favorite hostels around the world if you want to learn more.
        My favorite hostel booking website is Hostelworld. They have the best inventory, deals, and interface. If you’re going to book, book with them!

        	One of the best ways to get free accommodation is by staying with someone who lives where you’re going. Stay with a local who will give you a free place to rest your head, local information, and someone to hang out with. This is one of my favorite ways to save money and one that nets a really awesome cultural experience too.
        	There are a few websites that make this happen. Two of the most popular are:

            Couchsurfing
            BeWelcome
            To ensure I find a great host, I use the following criteria:
            There has to be a picture with the profile. This just shows me that it’s a real person.
            <p><span class= "font-weight-bold">The profile has to be filled out.</span> It shows they are interested and involved. Most people aren’t going to spend the time to fill this out if they aren’t going to be comfortable with strangers in their home. If someone hasn’t bothered to fill out the profile, they probably don’t use the site and I simply move on.</p>
            <p><span class= "font-weight-bold">They should have reviews.</span> If other people have stayed with or have at least traveled with the host and had a good experience, you and your stuff will probably be fine. The more positive reviews, the better.</p>
            <p><span class= "font-weight-bold">Verification helps.</span> Knowing that a person has been verified (by showing their ID to Couchsurfing) reduces the likelihood that they are going to be a crazy psycho killer. However, if someone isn’t verified but has a lot of reviews, that’s fine with me!
            <p><span class= "font-weight-bold">They should be active.</span> If the person hasn’t logged on in months, I won’t waste time applying to them.</p> <br>
            No matter what, you need to use your own judgment when picking a host. Usually, you end up messaging hosts to get a feel for them and what they expect. If it doesn’t feel right, there’s no obligation to stay with them. Once you Couchsurf for the first time, you’ll see that there really isn’t anything to fear. And, if you do it frequently, you’ll end up saving hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on accommodation while making friends around the world. <br>

        <p>WWOOF stands for “Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms” and WWOOFing around the world is an incredibly popular way to travel long-term on a budget. In exchange for working on an organic farm, travelers get free room and board — allowing them to extend their travels without breaking the bank. While you will have to work (and often work hard), it’s an amazing and immersive cultural experience that will help you extend your travels and save you lots of money.<br>
        There are thousands of farms spread out over 100 countries. Some stays are for a couple of weeks, while others can be for months. Simply sign up, pay the small fee, and you can start searching for opportunities!<br>
