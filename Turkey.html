        <p> Recently popular places - Turkey's adition <br>
            Turkey is a home to many natural wonders and those which are unique. Turkey is rich and abundant in flora and fauna, beaches, coastal parks, lakes, waterfalls, mountains, forests, and canyons. Past and extinct volcano attacks have left magical moon-like landscape in Cappadocia with many white valleys and fairy chimneys.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Manavgat falls near Side and Duden close to Antalya, flower-filled Butterfly Valley, close to Fethiye and The Koprulu Canyon are must-see nature spots.
            Turkey is a key country for global biodiversity conservation as a result of its location at the junction of three continents as well as Anatolia’s complex topography and geomorphology. These geographical features account for a great variety of habitats and species, and, particularly, for an exceptionally rich flora. The global map of biodiversity hotspot gives perhaps the best insight on Turkey’s global importance for conservation. Three out of 34 biodiversity hotspots meet in Turkey: Caucasus, the Mediterranean and the Irano-Anatolian. This exceptionally rich and unique biodiversity raises the significance of the work of Doğa, BirdLife Turkey, as a contribution to save world’s biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rate of endemism of animal species in Turkey is not as high as plants. Yet, Turkey forms the main range numerous globally threatened species. Moreover, current studies show that several endemic and threatened mammals, reptiles and amphibians occur in Turkey that remained unexplored until recently. Lycian salamanders (Lyciasalamandra sp.), frog species confined to the Taurus range and the Taurus suslic (Spermophilus taurensis) are examples of such rare species. The recent discoveries of two large mammals in Turkey, the globally threatened Mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) and the regionally threatened Anatolian Leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana), are key indications of how unexplored Turkey’s biodiversity is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirteen globally threatened species listed as Vulnerable (VU) occur in Turkey. For some of these, Turkey has high conservation value including the Common Pochard, Dalmatian Pelican, Yelkouan Shearwater, Eastern Imperial Eagle, Great Bustard and the European Turtle Dove. For example, Bosporus and Dardanelles are globally important migratory bottlenecks for the Yelkouan Shearwater. Turkey has recently been identified as a highly important breeding region for the Eastern Imperial Eagle as a result of new surveys and conservation projects. Another Vulnerable species, the Velvet Scoter has a very highly isolated breeding population in northeast Anatolia, which is inadequately studied taxonomically and for conservation purposes. Less widespread Vulnerable species include the Greater Spotted Eagle and Lesser White Fronted Goose having small wintering populations in western half of Turkey. The Houbara Bustard is recorded in central Turkey in December 2013, after more than hundred years. The status of this rare species in Turkey is not known.

  <h2 class="mb-3">What this country offers?</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Because this country has everything.</p>

  <p>
  	Stunning natural landscapes? -- Yep! From the rocky ethereal vistas of Cappadocia to lush valleys, crater lakes, tumbling rivers and snow-capped mountains, plus anything you can imagine in between.  There are so many beautiful places in Turkey!
  </p>
  <p>
    Turkey, located at the crossroads of Asia and Europe and bordering the romantic Aegean Sea, is a country with a diverse natural landscape. Here you can see its blue coastline in a gentle breeze and genial sunshine, a peaceful town with hot air balloons, as well as the ravine karst landform with thousands of caves.

    </div>

    <div class="col-md-7">
      <p>
        Historical attractions? -- Most definitely. It’s been the home of many empires stretching back over thousands of years including the Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, Armenians and Ottomans to name but a few.  And they certainly left a whole lot of stuff behind.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the modern secular republic was established in the 1920s by nationalist leader Kemal Ataturk. Straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, Turkey's strategically important location has given it major influence in the region - and control over the entrance to the Black Sea.
        Turkish history is unique due to its rich tapestry of cultural influences, shaped by the convergence of East and West. The rise of powerful empires, like the Hittites, Byzantines, and Ottomans, has left a profound legacy in art, architecture, and governance. Additionally, Turkey's strategic location as a crossroads of trade and migration has facilitated the exchange of ideas and traditions over millennia. This blend of diverse cultures makes Turkish history not only fascinating but also a key to understanding broader historical developments in Europe and Asia.

  <p>
    Breathtaking beaches? -- For sure! Turkey has 5000-plus miles of coastline along the Aegean, Mediterranean and Black Sea for sun-soakers to enjoy. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Turkey's coastline is renowned for its stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters, making it a premier destination for sun-seekers. The Aegean and Mediterranean coasts boast picturesque coves, ancient ruins, and vibrant marine life, offering a perfect mix of relaxation and adventure. Unique features, like the turquoise hues of the Lycian coast and the dramatic cliffs of the Black Sea, highlight the country’s diverse natural beauty. With a rich maritime history and a culture deeply connected to the sea, Turkey's beaches provide a captivating experience for visitors and locals alike.

        Fabulous cuisine? -- Ab-so-lut-ely. Elaborate mouthwatering breakfasts, delicious street food, succulent kebabs, desserts to die for and even a vegetarian and vegan scene. What’s not to love?
      </p>  
      <p>
        In Turkey breakfast (kahvaltı) is considered the most important meal of the day. Rather than just cereal or toast Turks start their day with a hearty spread including eggs, cheese, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, kaymak (clotted cream), sucuk (spicy Turkish sausage), and a variety of fresh breads.
        Turkish lunch (öğle yemeği) is often the main meal of the day. Restaurants have special set menus at midday featuring hearty appetizers, protein-focused mains, salads, and desserts.
        In the evenings, Turkish dinners (akşam yemeği) tend to be relaxed, multi-course affairs enjoyed slowly over conversation. Hot meze appetizers, kebabs, stews simmered for hours in clay pots, and fragrant pilafs grace the table.
       </p>
       <p>
         Snacking is a key part of Turkish food culture. Walking around Turkish cities, you’ll find an endless assortment of tantalizing street foods and snacks.
         Turks love their desserts (tatlı). Sugary treats like baklava, lokum, and kunefe satisfy cravings for something sweet after a savory meal.
         From aromatic teas to frothy coffee to refreshing juices, Turks enjoy a variety of hot and cold beverages with their meals.

  	     Friendly folks? -- The best! We’ve experienced the most insane levels of hospitality in Turkey including countless invitations for tea and dinner and have even stayed over at people’s houses while we’ve travelled around the country. Turkish people are friendly, generous and complete legends.

      <p>
         Hospitality is first and foremost what Turkish people are known for, and almost every visitor will have some story about a kind person who helped them or even invited them into their home for a meal with the family. You’ll soon come to find that Turkish people enjoy helping others and love to show their generosity to guests.
         Even though traditions are important in Turkey, Turkish people also know how to let loose and have a good time. Just go to any Turkish wedding to watch even the oldest grandma dance, or visit a tavern to see Turkish people singing their favourite songs alongside street musicians.
         As well as their amazing cooking skills, Turkey’s people have many talents, whether they are traditional craftspeople, fashion designers, actors, singers, athletes, film directors, authors or intellectuals.
         Family is very important in Turkey, and Turkish people always put family first, making sure to respect and take care of them. Many Turkish people prefer to live with their parents until they marry and start their own families.
         They are very proud to be Turkish, and they are enthusiastic when it comes to sharing their history and culture with visitors. No matter where you go, people will be more than willing to tell you stories about the history of their native cities or towns while showing you the sights.

        <p>
          As well as their family, Turkey’s people are very close to their friends, and have a deep respect for friendships. In Turkey, you can rely on your friends to be by your side during the best and worst of days.
          Turkish people are honest about their emotions and won’t hold back from expressing them. When a Turkish person is happy, they will make sure everyone around them feels it too.
