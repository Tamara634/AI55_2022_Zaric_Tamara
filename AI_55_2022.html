        <p> Travel vlogs and filtered social media posts rarely capture the less glamorous side of travel, and, to be honest, it can be tough for even the most intrepid traveler to get motivated to head into the unknown. Traveling can mean chaotic airports and rescheduled flights, flat tires, lost luggage, and frustrations big and small. The reasons to put off traveling until later can quickly stack up. However, traveling can also be the most transformative and fulfilling experience, filled with breathtaking sunrises on mountaintops, laughter and learning with locals, and moments of deep realization on forested trails.

                              <p>         
                               The most important tip to avoid unnecessary stress is to apply for your passport well in advance. Without your passport or a travel visa, your potential travel radius is limited significantly.
                               This can be an oversight for some people, but a passport validity of 10 years can make people complacent, forgetting that it actually requires renewing.
                               Many countries may not even let you enter if you have less than 6 months validity on your passport and your request for a visa may be denied if you don’t have enough free pages in your passport.
                               A general rule of thumb to follow is to make sure you have a valid passport at the time you're before booking your flight. The process for applying for and receiving your passport can potentially delay your trip if you don't apply in advance.
                               You’ll need to check in advance whether you need a visa which is a document issued by the destination country granting you entry. Showing up to your flight without the necessary visa may lead to you being rejected, especially if you cannot apply for one  on arrival.
                               US and UK passport holders can travel to quite a few countries without a visa, or they can receive one on arrival. However, rules vary between countries so be sure to thoroughly research the entry requirements.
                              </p>

                               <p>
                               It is important to invest plenty of time in researching your destination to optimize your experience. While it may seem more fun to travel spontaneously, it is far more practical if you are able to anticipate some of the nuances of your destination country by studying the tips for traveling abroad for the first time.
                               Aside from differences in language and culture, laws may vary too. Did you know that chewing gum is illegal in Singapore? Or that it’s illegal to feed pigeons in Venice? If your plan was to ride a cow while intoxicated in Scotland, you’ll find that that’s prohibited, too. Foreign countries are full of laws that may be strange to you, but that’s only because it is not your culture. Knowing them ahead of time can keep you out of trouble.
                               </p>

                               <p>
                               If you are certain of your itinerary, the best time to book your trip is whenever you have the money and the commitment to travel. While it is nice to have the freedom to make the last-minute choice of where to stay, don’t be surprised if accommodation is scarce or suddenly very pricey when you show up at your destination.
                               It is not unheard of that last-minute travelers end up scrambling for accommodation because they didn’t book anything beforehand. Not only will you end up paying more to book whatever is available, but being left without a place to stay is extremely stressful when you’re in a new place for the first time.
                               The same goes for transport tickets – you’ll find the best deals by booking beforehand! The peace of mind of having your itinerary planned seamlessly from start to finish is truly priceless. It gives you more time to devote to enjoying your trip and less time stressing about what comes next.<br>
                               <br>   
                               While you shouldn't preoccupy yourself with things that could go wrong on your trip, being aware of your surroundings and taking precautions to keep yourself safe will go a long way in enjoying your new adventure.
                               Packing appropriately can simplify your trip. Packing too much, too little, or simply setting off with a disorganized suitcase can all negatively affect your experience.
                               While traveling can be eye-opening and liberating, it can get lonely at times, especially if you are someone who suffers from homesickness. But going abroad doesn’t mean that you have to go without speaking to your friends or family. There are many ways in which you can keep in contact with loved ones, whether you are calling them every day or just sharing pictures of your travels!

        <p>There are some destinations that people rave about constantly — the popular spots around the world that everyone flocks to. But there are also so many underrated places that are severely underlooked. So, I asked the BuzzFeed Community to tell me about a destination they loved even more than expected. Here are some of their responses. I also shared one of my own favorite places and a handful of responses from some travel-loving Redditors.</p>
        
        <ul class="pl-5">
      <li>Moab - Utah</li>
      <li>Sintra - Portugal</li>
      <li>The Seto Inland Sea between Hiroshima, Beppu, and Kure</li>
      <li>Budapest - Hungary</li>
      <li>Sarajevo - Bosnia and Herzegovina</li>
      <li>Hydra, Greece</li>
