       Is the prospect of a relaxing solo beach vacation, one that offers the calming benefits of being near a body of water, calling to you?
       <br>

      Get ready–we have a lot of suggestions for you!
      <br>
      Not only do we have many destination recommendations for you, but every single one of them was contributed by a solo traveler who went there and enjoyed time alone on or near the water. This is no AI-created list, scraping content from random articles on the internet. This post is the result of many hours of work by members of the Solo Traveler community and us along with many hours of personal experience (research, if you will) in countries around the world.
      Humans are hardwired to relax near water. At least, that's what Wallace J. Nichols writes in Blue Mind: The Surprising Science That Shows How Being Near, In, On, or Under Water Can Make You Happier, Healthier, More Connected, and Better at What You Do. He says,
      </p>
     <div class="Citat1 mt-5">
     <p class="mb-3">
     "We are inspired by water—hearing it, smelling it in the air, playing in it, walking next to it, painting it, surfing, swimming or fishing in it, writing about it, photographing it, and creating lasting memories along its edge. Indeed, throughout history, you see our deep connection to water described in art, literature, and poetry… We know instinctively that being by water makes us healthier, happier, reduces stress, and brings us peace."
     </p>
    </div>
 
    <p>I feel the truth of this in my bones. I grew up on a lake, spent the summers of my childhood on a boat or at a cottage on another lake, and have spent much of my adult life living a block from yet another lake. I sleep like a baby when I can hear the waves. When I'm stressed, I head to the beach to breathe the air, feel the wind on my face, and stare at the horizon. When I travel, there's nothing better to me than accommodations that overlook bodies of water, whether the climate lends itself to jumping in or not.
	<br>
    <br>
    I'm taking an expansive view of what constitutes a solo beach vacation. It doesn't only mean the type of holiday where you lay on the beach all day–not that there's anything wrong with that! In fact, if that's your preference, check out this popular post to help you prepare: Going to the Beach Alone: How to Manage Your Stuff, Relax & Enjoy. But as Nichols suggests, just being near water has tremendous health and mental health benefits.
    Water destinations are some of the best places to travel alone, relax, and find a happier you.

        <div class="row">

        <p>Anse Lazio has often been described as the most beautiful beach in the world thanks to its perfect mixture of pristine golden sand, crystal-clear water, and impressive granite formations. This reputation means it is busier than many Seychelles beaches, so anyone looking to avoid other tourists should arrive early (before 09.00) to beat the crowds.
        </p>
        <p>
        Arrival at the beach is easiest by car, with three parking areas near to the beach, behind the tree line. The closest bus stop is a little further away, although some hotels do offer shuttle services to Anse Lazio as it is so famous.
	    <br>
        For many people, the first time they see Anse Lazio, the moment takes their breath away. The perfect combination of sun, sea, and sand make it an incredible beach by anyone’s definition. There is a designated swimming area surrounded by a net which keeps fish and other creatures from disturbing swimmers, and there is often a lifeguard on-duty, ensuring visitors can feel safe while they’re in the water. The beach is also excellent for snorkelling, with great visibility in the crystal-clear water, and is equally well-suited to families thanks to the large, sandy areas where children can play. However, the water does get deep quickly, so children and unconfident swimmers should stay in the designated area and try not to stray too far from the shore.
	    </p>
		<p>
        In terms of facilities, there are small shops and a few restaurants at each end of the beach where you can enjoy lunch or dinner if you wish. There is also an interesting bar called the Honesty Bar, which employs no waiters, waitresses, or barmen. Customers simply help themselves, then pay for what they took. This bar overlooks a small cove, making it a great place for a relaxing, refreshing drink or two after a day at the beach.

        <p>Renowned for its iconic Fofoti trees, this pristine beach beckons a trip. There are low-rise hotels and beach resorts lining the shores, but the beach is mostly quiet. The waters are also relatively calm in the designated swimming zones. Boat tours and water activities like snorkeling and jet skiing are popular here as well. If you're lucky, you may even spot turtles nesting or hatching on the shore between March and September. Eagle Beach is also a popular wedding photoshoot location—many newlyweds come to snap their wedding photos against the blissful Caribbean waters. 
        <br>
        Eagle Beach has been rated as one of the best beaches in the world and a top beach in the Caribbean time and time again. This pristine long stretch of beach with soft white sands and aqua blue waters features a variety of water sports and some palapas. Eagle Beach is a favorite among locals and tourists and is located in front of the low-rise hotels. The beach is the host of Aruba's most photographed Fofoti tree (now protected) and is known to be a favorite nesting spot for sea turtles.

        <p>Located on the southwest coast of Crete, this remote beach is best known for its pink sand. However, temper your expectations as the amount of pink on display varies with conditions and the season. Regardless, the crystal clear waters make this a popular summer vacation spot, attracting sunbathers and watersport enthusiasts alike. Also, hike up to the neighboring cedar tree reserves for a change of scenery. Visit in the morning to beat traffic and secure a chair and umbrella before the crowds arrive. Or come in the evening for a stunning sunset when most people have left.
